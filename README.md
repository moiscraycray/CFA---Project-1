# CFA---Project-1

Olivia (moiscraycray), Carmen (carmenhchung), James (J1marotta) and Nathan (nathankwon) for our Group project "Impress Trent"


## Note to windows users

Unfortunately, this program will only run on Apple Macs. Our team have tried to get it working on PCs but the gem, catpix, and associated gems are very difficult to install.


## Synopsis

The program is a game where users will guess whether the printed image is Trent (our teacher) or not. The game will track and tally the score at the end of the game.


## Motivation

We were asked to build something that would excite, entertain, and surprise the user (in this case, Trent). We decided the best approach would be to examine his social media accounts (predominantly his Facebook and Instagram) to discover what he was interested in. 

We quickly found that he has a lot of selfies so our team decided to build a game around them. 

Our game is called: "Is That Trent? or Not?"


## Installation

 You will need CATPIX, and artii gems installed
 catpix, has additional requirements of TCO gem, and Rmagic,

 Rmagic has the additional requirements of version 6 of image magick


 Additionally you will need to save the files into home/user/sites/project1
 Including the trent and not trent directory folders so the program can correctly
 find the pictures it uses. These can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4E-nX-9D2HIeEQ5VnVaZmlPTXM?usp=sharing
